# The Absolution Modpack To-Do List
## High priority
- [ ] Prevent Eridanus from being summoned before all other champions have passed away
- [ ] Change the effect of the Eridanus armor to require double-tapping DOWN instead of the time-based bullshittery
## Medium priority
- [x] Add the Yea Painting item with a placeholder set of conditions for dropping from the Painter
## Low priority
- [ ] Create the various Eternity Mode modded items
- [ ] Expand the Clicker Class into post-Moon Lord (and change existing clickers)

PRIORITIES
- High priority: Progression and balance changes, the main part of the modpack
- Medium priority: New items (Bard/Healer/Clicker class expansions, Eternity Mode accessories, etc.)
- Low priority: Anything involving AI (boss tweaks for Thorium/SoA, new Champions)
- Lowest priority: Adding any more big mods to the pack (must exist as crossmod in Souls DLC before doing this at all)
